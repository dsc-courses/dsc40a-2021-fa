    "Homework 8, the final homework of the quarter, will work a little differently. All of the questions you need to answer will be in this Jupyter Notebook. With that said, you won't have to submit this notebook; as per usual, write your solutions to the problems by either typing them up or handwriting them on a piece of paper. Homeworks are due to Gradescope by 11:59pm on the due date. You can use a slip day to extend the deadline by 24 hours. Make sure to correctly assign pages to Gradescope when submitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework will be evaluated not only on the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas clearly and logically. You should always explain and justify your conclusions, using sound reasoning. Your goal should be to convince the reader of your assertions. If a question does not require explanation, it will be explicitly stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks should be written up and turned in by each student individually. You may talk to other students in the class about the problems and discuss solution strategies, but you should not share any written communication and you should not check answers with classmates. You can tell someone how to do a homework problem, but you cannot show them how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each problem you submit, you should cite your sources by including a list of names of other students with whom you discussed the problem. Instructors do not need to be cited.\n",
    "\n",
