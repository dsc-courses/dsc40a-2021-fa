## Videos from Previous Quarters

In the table below, you can find lecture videos created by Janine Tiefenbruck, who created this course and taught it many times. The lecture videos linked below will generally be pretty similar in content coverage to our lectures, but there will be occasional differences. You are responsible for everything covered in our lectures, even if something doesn't appear in the videos below. When in doubt, refer to the main lecture slides posted and ask on Campuswire.

## Other Resources

- Other lectures on [Loss Functions](http://ds100.org/su20/lecture/lec11) and [Simple Linear Regression](http://ds100.org/su20/lecture/lec12/).
    - These are from a different course for a different audience, and use different notation and terminology. However, the high-level ideas are similar to those in the first few weeks of our course.

## Past Exams

Below, you'll find some exams (and in some cases, their solutions) from previous offerings of the course. Note that topic coverage and ordering has changed over time, so the content in our Midterm won't necessary match the content of earlier Midterms/Midterm 1.

(In many earlier offerings of the course, there were two Midterms â€“ Midterm 1 covered empirical risk minimization, and Midterm 2 covered probability. That is not the case in Fall 2021.)
