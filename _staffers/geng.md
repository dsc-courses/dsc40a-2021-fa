Hi, my name is Jianming Geng, and I am from Shenzhen, China. I am a rising Junior; in the meantime, I am pursuing a degree in both data science and applied math. As a tutor for DSC40A, I am most excited about the learning experience as well as teaching interactions that will happen in this classroom. One of my fun facts is that I like to bite my fingers when in nerve.
