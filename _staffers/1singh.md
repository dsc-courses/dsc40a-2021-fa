I'm Harpreet, from New Delhi, India, pursuing MS in Computer Science at UCSD. I'm really excited to work as TA in DSC40A since the course content is very similar to my field of specialization i.e. AI and moreover I love managerial roles and positions and really like to interact with the different people - students, instructors, tutors etc. I'm a beach person which is one of my strong motivation for joining UCSD ðŸ˜… (Lol strong CSE department is the major motivation). I also like gymming and hiking.
